# Exhaust Parts  

This folder contains *.dxf files that can be uploaded to a laser cutting service's website [sendcutsend, for example] and used to have near reproduction parts manufactured.  
Parts should be imported as being in "mm" mode, or Metric.  
There may be minor discrpencies between the models and the parts on the car. An example of this is that in Cat-Flange, I have designed for a loose fit of M8 bolts for all mounting. This means that the join between the bracket and the flange will need different hardware.  
I also am not including any instructions on bending, tapping, or other finishing operations in these files.  If you would like these, feel free to open an issue with the appropriate information on location and size of features.

Cat-Bracket.dxf should be ~4mm mild steel
Cat-Flange.dxf should be ~8mm mild steel
